# Seedforge — Logo Prompts (Pixel Art / 8-Bit Direction)

## The Concept
A glowing seed being shaped on an anvil — raw potential being forged into something real. Rendered in a warm, nostalgic pixel art style that immediately says "this is a game." Think the charm of Stardew Valley's icon, the nostalgia of classic RPG inventory items, and the warmth of a campfire scene in a 16-bit adventure.

## Primary Logo Prompts

### Prompt 1 — Pixel Art Icon (App Icon / Primary Mark)

```
Pixel art logo icon, 32x32 or 64x64 pixel grid. A glowing seed sitting on a small anvil. The seed is a warm amber-gold pixel shape, cracked slightly open with bright golden light spilling out, rendered as bright yellow and white pixels at the centre fading to amber at the edges. Tiny green pixel sprouts emerge from the top of the seed. The anvil is dark iron grey pixels, simple and chunky. 2-3 pixel spark particles float upward, transitioning from gold to green as they rise. Black or very dark background to make the glow pop. Style: 16-bit RPG item icon, like a legendary item in a SNES-era game. Limited colour palette: 8-12 colours maximum. Warm, inviting, immediately reads as "game."
```

### Prompt 2 — Pixel Art Icon (Larger Detail Version)

```
Detailed pixel art illustration, 128x128 pixels. A magical glowing seed being forged on a weathered anvil. The seed pulses with inner golden-green light, pixel glow effect radiating outward in concentric lighter pixels. Small roots and tendrils grow down from the seed, wrapping around the anvil in green pixels. The anvil sits on a mossy stone base with tiny pixel mushrooms and flowers growing at its feet. Pixel sparks and floating seed particles drift upward like embers. Style: Stardew Valley item art meets classic RPG crafting station. Rich but limited palette: forest greens, warm golds, amber, charcoal, moss, touches of teal. Dark atmospheric background with subtle pixel stars or fireflies.
```

### Prompt 3 — Pixel Scene (Hero Image / Marketing)

```
16-bit pixel art scene of a magical forest forge. Centre frame: a stone anvil with a brilliant glowing seed on top, radiating warm golden light that illuminates the surrounding pixel trees and plants. The forge area has pixel moss, tiny flowers, hanging vines, and a small workbench with tools. A pixel character (small, cute, wearing a simple gardening outfit and hat) stands beside the anvil, looking up at the glowing seed with wonder. Fireflies and glowing spores float through the scene. The forest canopy frames the top of the image with dappled pixel light filtering through. Style: Stardew Valley / Celeste / Eastward aesthetic. Cozy, magical, adventurous. Palette: deep forest greens, warm amber glow, cool blue-greens in shadows, golden highlights.
```

### Prompt 4 — Pixel Wordmark

```
Pixel art logo text "SEEDFORGE" in a custom 8-bit typeface. Letters are chunky, bold, and slightly rounded — friendly not aggressive. The word is rendered in warm cream/white pixels with a 1-pixel dark outline for definition. The 'O' contains a tiny glowing seed pixel icon (gold centre, green edge). Subtle pixel glow effect behind the text in warm amber. Below the text, a small pixel anvil with a seed serves as an underline or accent. Optional: tiny pixel leaves or sparks decorating the corners of the text. Style: retro game title screen font, like Stardew Valley or Undertale logo treatment. Colours: cream text, gold accents, forest green highlights, charcoal outline, on dark background.
```

### Prompt 5 — Animated Pixel Icon (for loading screens / splash)

```
Pixel art animation concept (describe as keyframes): Frame 1 — A dark anvil sits alone. Frame 2 — A small dull seed drops onto the anvil from above. Frame 3 — The seed begins to glow, warm amber pixels appearing at its centre. Frame 4 — The glow intensifies, bright gold and white pixels, cracks appear in the seed. Frame 5 — Tiny green sprouts burst from the top of the seed, pixel sparks fly upward. Frame 6 — Full glow achieved, the seed radiates light, sparks transform into floating pixel leaves and spores that drift upward and outward. The word "SEEDFORGE" fades in below in pixel text. Style: 16-bit game intro animation, 6-8 frames, loopable from frame 6. Warm palette: golds, greens, charcoal.
```

### Prompt 6 — Favicon / Tiny Icon (16x16)

```
Extremely simplified pixel art icon, 16x16 pixel grid. A single glowing seed shape: pointed oval, 3-4 pixels tall, bright gold centre pixel with amber surrounding pixels and a single green pixel sprout on top. Must be instantly recognisable at browser tab size. Maximum 4 colours: gold, amber, green, dark outline. No anvil at this size — just the iconic seed glow. Style: NES-era item sprite, iconic and minimal.
```

## Colour Palette (Pixel Art Optimised)

Pixel art works best with a tight, intentional palette. Here's a 16-colour master palette:

| # | Role | Colour | Hex |
|---|------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Dark base | Near-black | `#1A1A2E` |
| 2 | Shadow | Deep charcoal | `#2D2D3F` |
| 3 | Anvil dark | Iron grey | `#4A4A5E` |
| 4 | Anvil light | Steel grey | `#6B6B7F` |
| 5 | Forest dark | Deep green | `#1E3A2F` |
| 6 | Forest mid | Rich green | `#2D5A3D` |
| 7 | Leaf | Bright green | `#4CAF50` |
| 8 | Sprout | Light green | `#81C784` |
| 9 | Glow dark | Deep amber | `#B8721A` |
| 10 | Glow mid | Warm gold | `#E8A838` |
| 11 | Glow bright | Golden yellow | `#F5D77A` |
| 12 | Glow hot | Bright highlight | `#FFF4C2` |
| 13 | Teal | Accent cool | `#1A6B5C` |
| 14 | Rust | Warning / low vitality | `#A65D3F` |
| 15 | Cream | Light text / BG | `#FFF8F0` |
| 16 | White | Pure highlight | `#FFFFFF` |

This palette supports the full range of game UI needs — the warm glow cluster (9-12) is the hero, greens (5-8) for growth/nature, greys (2-4) for structure, and the dark base (1) for backgrounds.

## Typography (Pixel-Compatible)

| Use | Style | Examples |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Logo / Title | Custom pixel font, chunky, warm | Hand-pixelled or based on Press Start 2P, modified to be rounder and friendlier |
| Headings (in-app) | Pixel-inspired but crisp at all sizes | Silkscreen, Pixelify Sans, or a custom bitmap font |
| Body (in-app) | Clean sans-serif (pixel fonts are hard to read at body size) | Inter, DM Sans — pixel aesthetic is for accents, not everything |
| Game UI (XP, levels, achievements) | Pixel font | Press Start 2P, VT323, or custom |
| Notifications / tooltips | Clean readable | Inter, system font |

**Key principle:** Pixel fonts for game-feel moments (level ups, XP awards, achievement names, titles). Clean modern fonts for anything that needs to be read at length (lesson content, project descriptions, reflection prompts). The pixel style is the seasoning, not the whole meal.

## Art Style Direction

### The sweet spot
- **Stardew Valley** — warm, detailed pixel art with personality and charm
- **Eastward** — slightly higher-res pixel art with beautiful lighting and atmosphere
- **Celeste** — clean pixel characters with expressive animation
- **Habitica** — nostalgic RPG pixel sprites (but Seedforge should feel higher quality / more polished)

### What distinguishes Seedforge from Habitica visually
- **Higher pixel resolution** — 16-bit (SNES era) not 8-bit (NES era). More detail, smoother gradients, richer colours
- **Warm lighting** — everything has a warm golden glow. Habitica is flat and evenly lit. Seedforge has atmosphere.
- **Nature-dominant** — where Habitica is dungeon/fantasy themed, Seedforge is forest/garden themed
- **Glow effects** — the seed glow is the signature visual. Warm light radiating from organic sources (seeds, flowers, fireflies, bioluminescence)

### Visual elements across the product
- **Garden view:** Isometric or top-down pixel art garden, each plant a pixel sprite
- **Character/avatar:** ~32px tall pixel sprite, customisable outfit, companion at their side
- **Companions:** Small pixel creatures (8-16px), animated idle loops (bobbing, blinking)
- **Equipment:** Pixel item icons in inventory grid, styled like RPG gear
- **Achievement badges:** Pixel art medallions / crests
- **Level-up screen:** Pixel explosion of sparks and leaves, screen flash, chunky pixel text
- **The Potting Shed (shop):** Pixel art storefront with shelved items
- **XP bar:** Pixel progress bar with glowing fill, chunky numbers

## Logo Variations Needed

1. **App icon (1024x1024, pixel-rendered)** — seed-on-anvil mark, no text, sharp pixel edges
2. **Full logo (horizontal)** — pixel icon + "SEEDFORGE" pixel wordmark
3. **Stacked logo** — pixel icon above "SEEDFORGE" text
4. **Favicon (16x16, 32x32)** — simplified glowing seed only
5. **Dark mode** — all variants on `#1A1A2E` background
6. **Light mode** — all variants on `#FFF8F0` background
7. **Animated variant** — the seed-glow animation for splash/loading screens
8. **Social media banner** — wider pixel scene version (Prompt 3) with logo overlaid
