# Seedforge — Music Prompts

> Background instrumental music for a pixel-art learning game. The sound should feel like a cosy 16-bit adventure — warm, curious, gently motivating. Think Stardew Valley's farm theme meets Zelda's exploration music meets a lo-fi study playlist. Never stressful, always inviting.

## Production Notes

### Consistency across tracks
- All tracks should share the same core palette of sounds (specific chiptune voice, the same acoustic guitar tone, the same soft percussion kit)
- The main theme melody motif should appear as a subtle callback in other tracks (a few notes of it in the garden theme, a variation in the quest theme)
- Warm golden tone throughout — never cold, harsh, or clinical
- Target loudness: -14 to -16 LUFS (background music, not foreground)

### Technical requirements
- All loopable tracks must have clean loop points (no fade-in/fade-out, seamless when repeated)
- Deliver in WAV (lossless) and MP3 (128kbps for web streaming)
- Level up jingle should have a sharp attack and clean tail (no reverb bleed past 8 seconds)
- All tracks should sound good on phone speakers (check low-end isn't muddy)

### What to avoid
- ❌ Heavy bass drops or EDM energy
- ❌ Minor key / dark / tense moods (even the night theme should feel hopeful)
- ❌ Vocals or vocal chops
- ❌ Overly complex melodies that demand attention
- ❌ Pure chiptune with no organic instruments (we want the blend)
- ❌ Anything that would feel stressful on loop after 30 minutes

## Priority Order for Generation

1. **Garden View / Home Screen** — this is what users hear most, get it right first
2. **Building / Learning Mode** — the focus music they'll spend hours with
3. **Main Theme / Title Screen** — the first impression, the identity
4. **Level Up Jingle** — short, high impact, used constantly
5. **Quest / Expedition Theme** — for the adventure moments
6. **Night / Reflection Mode** — for end-of-session wind-down
7. **Shop Theme** — nice to have, lower priority
8. **Streak / Momentum** — situational, build last
